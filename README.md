# PersHomology
A first attempt to learn what is persistent homology
This contains 4 jupyter notebooks:
1) it explains how to see data points in the context of topology, and homology groups are defined 
2) it describes algorithms to compute homology groups and Betti numbers
3) persistent homology and code bars are introduced, the code is improved
4) a couple of examples from chemistry and biology are given
