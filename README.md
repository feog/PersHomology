# PersHomology
A first attempt to learn what is persistent homology
This contains 4 jupyter notebooks:
1) it explains how to see data points in the context of topology, homology groups and Betti numbers are defined and computed 
2) persistent homology and code bars are introduced
3) the code is improved and some examples are computed
4) a couple of examples from chemistry and biology are given
